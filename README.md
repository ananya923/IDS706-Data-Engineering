# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
# This project contains Ananya Jogalekar's submission for an assignment in IDS 706.
# Using GitHub Codespaces, the project implements a Python script with two functions:
# The first function prints a welcome message for the name of the person provided as input.
# The second function takes two numbers and returns their sum.
# A test case file successfully tests the code.

# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# Set up a repository in GitHub and create files: Makefile, hello.py (this will contain the Python program), requirements.txt, and test_hello.py.
# The Makefile should contain functions for install, format, lint, test, clean, and all.
# The requirements file should list all requirements for this project: pylint, flake8, pytest, click, black, and pytest-cov
# In the Python script file, define functions from the project description.
# In the test file, write test cases for both functions.

# USAGE EXAMPLES:
# This project is an introductory assignment in implementing GitHub workflows. It can be used to welcome people into the IDS 706 course and perform basic numeric additions.
